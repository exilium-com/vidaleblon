One of my favorites is CT Boucherie. Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s worth it.
CT Boucherie was created by chef Claude Troisgros, one of the most renowned names in Brazilian gastronomy. He is the son of Pierre Troisgros, one of the founders of the French nouvelle cuisine, and brought to Brazil his experience and creativity in the kitchen. The mix he makes of French cuisine with Brazilian ingredients is fantastic.</description></item><item><title>Perfect Day</title><link>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/dianoleblon1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/dianoleblon1/</guid><description>I woke up early today and went straight to the beach, at Posto 11, which is three blocks from my apartment. The sun was shining, the sky was blue and the sand was warm. I took off all my jewelry, put the exact money for a coconut water and a beach umbrella in my bag. I put on my favorite bikini, grabbed my canga (brazilian sarong), book and sunscreen and went to enjoy the sea.</description></item><item><title>Degrau</title><link>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/degrau/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/degrau/</guid><description>One of my favorite restaurants in Rio de Janeiro is Restaurante Degrau in Leblon. This place is a classic of Carioca gastronomy, with almost 60 years of history and quality. The name comes from a step at the entrance that made many people stumble; the restaurant moved but the name stuck and now it’s part of the place’s charm. By the way, next door is Tropeço, a more casual bar from the same owners, with a similar kitchen.</description></item><item><title>Boteco Princesa</title><link>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/princesa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/princesa/</guid><description>The Boteco Princesa, which opened recently in Leblon, is the new bet of chef Pedro de Artagão, one of the most renowned names in Rio’s gastronomy. Boteco Princesa is a charming and laid-back place, with a decoration that mixes Portuguese and Carioca elements, and a menu that brings classic Brazilian cuisine dishes with a special touch.
The atmosphere is extremely lively, the service very friendly, the food fantastic and the price very fair.</description></item><item><title>Peixoto Sushi</title><link>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/peixoto/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/peixoto/</guid><description>Today I want to share with you an incredible gastronomic experience that I had at Peixoto Sushi, a Japanese restaurant that recently opened in Leblon, one of the most charming neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro. Peixoto Sushi is an extension of Peixoto Deli, a famous fish market in Bairro Peixoto, in Copacabana, which offers fresh and high-quality fish. The couple Beni and Viviane Schvartz, owners of the fish market and the restaurant, are passionate about oriental cuisine and fishing, and decided to fulfill their dream of having their own sushi bar.</description></item></channel></rss>
