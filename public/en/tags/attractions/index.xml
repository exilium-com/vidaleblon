I woke up early because I forgot to close the shades, went out to buy fresh bread at Zona Sul, not a person in sight. I had breakfast with cappuccino, minas cheese, bread and papaya. It would already be a wonderful day. It was still early, I decided to walk on the boardwalk, which was strangely empty for a weekday, a winter day in Rio.</description></item><item><title>Mirante</title><link>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/mirante/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.vidaleblon.com/en/post/mirante/</guid><description>An amazing place to visit in Rio de Janeiro is the Mirante do Leblon (Leblon Lookout). This is a tourist spot that offers a fantastic view of Leblon and Ipanema beaches, as well as Pedra do Arpoador and is right under the Morro Dois Irmãos. It’s a perfect place to take photos, enjoy the sunset and feel the sea breeze.
The Mirante is located at the end of Leblon beach, at the beginning of Avenida Niemeyer, on top of the rocks.</description></item></channel></rss>
